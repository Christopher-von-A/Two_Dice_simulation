Hej Gökce

here is my program for the Two Dice Simulation

## Two Dice Simulation:
-----------------------
This project simulates rolling two six-sided dice 50,000 times and records how often each possible sum (2–12) occurs. 
The goal is to demonstrate the distribution of dice roll outcomes using basic C programming concepts such as arrays, loops, and random number generation.


## How It Works:
----------------
- Two dice are rolled using random numbers from 1 to 6.

- The sum of the two dice is calculated.

- An array stores how many times each sum (2–12) appears.

- After 50,000 rolls, the program prints the number of occurrences for each sum.

## Output Example:
------------------
 2: 1389
 
 3: 2778
 
 4: 4175
 
 5: 5564
 
 6: 6940
 
 7: 8333
 
 8: 6948
 
 9: 5561
 
10: 4178

11: 2780

12: 1354
